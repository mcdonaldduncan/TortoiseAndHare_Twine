# TortoiseAndHare_Twine

A short Twine story made to show the viability of branching narratives. This story follows a war between amphibians and mammals where your decisions will have the power to tilt the outcome in favor of one party or another. The project will engage the player in a rich narrative and allow their choices to impact the world they are playing in. I hope to achieve an enjoyable and interesting story filled with unique characters and storylines. Immersion is created through narrative beats but I will include interactivity as it is required. My goal was to have multiple branches that cross over at different points while keeping the overall scope to only a few final outcomes. Those outcomes can be reached via different paths but the story still remains whole.
